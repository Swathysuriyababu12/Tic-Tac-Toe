<h1>Objective: Create a Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive web-based Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will allow two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to achieve a winning pattern of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or to fill the entire grid without a winning pattern, resulting in a tie.

<h1>Project Components:</h1>

<h2>HTML Structure (index.html):</h2>

Create a user interface that includes a game heading, a grid of cells, a status display, and a reset button.
Define the layout using HTML elements and apply basic styling.


<h2>Styling (style.css):</h2>

Apply styles to improve the visual appearance of the game, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.


<h2>Game Logic (script.js):</h2>

Implement the game logic to alternate between two players (X and O) as they make moves.
Allow players to click on empty cells to place their respective symbols.
Check for a winning combination or a tie condition after each move.
Display appropriate messages in the status display based on the game outcome.

Winning and Tie Conditions:

Define winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) to determine when a player wins.
Detect a tie condition when all cells are filled without a winning combination.
Reset Functionality:

Implement a reset button that clears the board and resets the game state, allowing players to start a new game.

<h1>Outcome:</h1>

Upon completion of this project, players will be able to enjoy a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game in a web browser. They can play against each other, taking turns to place their symbols on the grid, and the game will accurately determine the winner or declare a tie based on the gameplay. The game's intuitive interface, attractive styling, and interactive nature will provide an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.
